# Concerts Challenge

## Overview

This project involves managing a Concert domain with three primary entities: `Band`, `Venue`, and `Concert`. The relationships between these entities are as follows:

- A `Band` can have many `Concerts`.
- A `Venue` can host many `Concerts`.
- A `Concert` is associated with one `Band` and one `Venue`.

The project uses SQLAlchemy for ORM and Alembic for database migrations.

## Project Structure

- `models.py`: Contains SQLAlchemy model definitions for `Band`, `Venue`, and `Concert`.
- `app.py`: Contains the code to create and query instances of `Band`, `Venue`, and `Concert`.
- `migrations/`: Contains migration scripts generated by Alembic.
